	Dear {{contact.first_name}}, 

	Thank you for donating to the Wikimedia Foundation. You are
wonderful! 

	It's easy to ignore our fundraising banners, and I'm really glad you
didn't. This is how Wikipedia pays its bills --- people like you giving us
money, so we can keep the site freely available for everyone around the
world. 

	People tell me they donate to Wikipedia because they find it useful,
and they trust it because even though it's not perfect, they know it's
written for them. Wikipedia isn’t meant to advance somebody's PR agenda or
push a particular ideology, or to persuade you to believe something that's
not true. We aim to tell the truth, and we can do that because of you.
The fact that you fund the site keeps us independent and able to deliver
what you need and want from Wikipedia. Exactly as it should be. 

	You should know: your donation isn’t just covering your own costs.
The average donor is paying for his or her own use of Wikipedia, plus the
costs of hundreds of other people. Your donation keeps Wikipedia available
for an ambitious kid in Bangalore who’s teaching herself computer
programming. A middle-aged homemaker in Vienna who’s just been diagnosed with
Parkinson’s disease. A novelist researching 1850s Britain. A 10-year-old in San
Salvador who’s just discovered Carl Sagan. 

	On behalf of those people, and the half-billion other readers of
Wikipedia and its sister sites and projects, I thank you for joining us in our
effort to make the sum of all human knowledge available for everyone. Your
donation makes the world a better place. Thank you. 

	Most people don't know Wikipedia's run by a non-profit. Please
consider sharing this e-mail with a few of your friends to encourage them to
donate too. And if you're interested, you should try adding some new
information to Wikipedia. If you see a typo or other small mistake, please fix
it, and if you find something missing, please add it. There are resources
here [1] that can help you get started. Don't worry about making a
mistake: that's normal when people first start editing and if it happens,
other Wikipedians will be happy to fix it for you. 

	I appreciate your trust in us, and I promise you we'll use your money
well. 

	Thanks,
 Sue
